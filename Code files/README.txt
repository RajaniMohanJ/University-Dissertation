Code testing instructions
To run and test the coding scripts developed to perform the current project, the marker/ viewer 
needs to run the google Colab notebooks that are present in the google drive of the researcher. 

The drive folder can be accessed through the following link:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LdVEHB0wBnpZYiPt6hkVSnOeNo1uSnG3?usp=sharing

The Colab notebook files need to be run or viewed in the following order to understand 
the flow of the project properly:

1.	Go to the “code” sub folder.
2.	Run the “Project EDA” notebook and close it at the end of execution.
3.	Then run the “Project LSTM” notebook and close it at the end of execution.
4.	Then run the “Project BiLSTM” notebook and close it at the end of execution.
5.	Then run the “Project GRU” notebook and close it at the end of execution.
6.	Finally, run the “Project BiGRU” notebook and close it at the end of execution.

As an additional accessibility, the researcher will try to attach copies of the above mention 
Colab notebooks at the additional submission area for the project.

The data generated after EDA are also being submitted in a separate zip file name "Generated_data".
These data are used in the Project LSTM, Project BiLSTM, Project GRU and Project BiGRU scripts.
